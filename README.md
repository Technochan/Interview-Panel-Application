# Interview Panel Application Documentation
## Introduction

The Interview Panel Application facilitates the efficient management of candidate interviews by receptionists. It includes modules for candidate management, interview control, and receptionist control. Additionally, the application will be enhanced today to support data serialization to JSON format for persistent storage and deserialization of previous session records upon application startup.



Modules:
Login Module:

Provides secure authentication for receptionists to access the application.
Manage Candidate Module:

Allows receptionists to add, update, and remove candidate details.
Facilitates the management of candidate interviews.
Manage Interview Module:

Enables receptionists to control the interview process, including starting, ending, and monitoring interviews.
Receptionist Control Module:

Serves as the main control panel, offering navigation options for accessing different functionalities of the application.
Key Features:
Data Serialization to JSON:

Implemented functionality to serialize candidate details, interview records, and other relevant data into JSON format.
Utilized libraries such as Jackson or Gson for conversion of Java objects to JSON representations.
File Storage for Serialized Data:

Designed a file storage mechanism to store the serialized JSON data persistently.
Chose JSON files and organized them in an appropriate directory structure.
Serialization on Application Shutdown:

Integrated logic to trigger data serialization when the application is shut down gracefully.
Ensured all relevant data is serialized and saved to designated files before exiting the application.
Deserialization on Application Startup:

Implemented logic to deserialize stored JSON data upon application startup.
Read serialized data from files and converted it back into Java objects using JSON deserialization.
Additional Points for Today's Implementation:
Error Handling for Serialization/Deserialization:

Implemented error handling to manage exceptions and errors during serialization and deserialization processes.
Provided informative error messages and fallback mechanisms to recover from failures.
Data Integrity and Validation:

Validated integrity of deserialized data to ensure conformity to expected formats and structures.
Implemented data validation checks to detect and handle inconsistencies or anomalies in deserialized data.
Performance Optimization:

Optimized serialization and deserialization processes to minimize overhead and improve application performance.
Considered factors such as data size, speed, and resource utilization for efficient data handling.
Backup and Restore Functionality:

Supported backup and restore functionalities for serialized data.
Allowed users to create backups of data files and restore them as needed to recover from data loss or corruption.
Conclusion:
With the integration of data serialization to JSON format and deserialization of previous session records, the Interview Panel Application enhances its reliability and persistence. By ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval across application sessions, the application continues to streamline candidate interview management for receptionists effectively.
